Title:- The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.
TypeScript’s type system is known for adding flexibility and safety to JavaScript. Two of its powerful features, union and intersection types, help us create more adaptable and robust code. 
1. Union Types:-
If we have a value that is a union type, we can only access members that are common to all types in the union.Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types of values. For instance, if a variable can be a string or a number, a union type covers both options:

             ##  For example ##

let value: number | string | boolean;
value = "Hello";  
value = 42;  

Union types are handy when data could come in different forms (such as number | string | boolean for IDs), making code more flexible without losing type safety.

2.	Intersection Types:- 
Intersection types are closely related to union types, but they are used very differentl.Intersection types let us merge multiple types together, so an object must have all specified properties. This is especially useful for defining complex data shapes or composing behaviors:

            ##  For example ##

type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };
type EmployeeInfo = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeeInfo = {
  name: "ssjoy",
  employeeId: 8773
};

Union types make our code more flexible by allowing variables to hold different types of values. Intersection types help us create complete structures by combining multiple types into one. Together, they let us write code that’s flexible, safe, and easy to scale—making them valuable tools for any TypeScript developer.
